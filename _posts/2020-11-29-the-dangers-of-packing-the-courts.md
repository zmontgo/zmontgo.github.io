With the tumultuous 2020 election coming to a close, there has been substantial talk about the possibility of the Biden administration ‘packing the courts’. The fact that the Biden campaign has refused to answer whether they would pursue this sort of action if elected is rightly concerning to many. To be clear, packing the courts is the process by which a president nominates more justices with aligning political beliefs than empty seats to the courts. If such action were to be taken, the checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution as well as the representative nature of the government would be undermined.

The framers of the Constitution of the United States set in place three branches of government in order to check and balance each other, namely, the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Legislative branch, as established in Article 1 of the Constitution, is an elected branch that reserves the power of creating the legislation. The Executive branch, according to Article 2, is also elected by the people and tasked with enforcing the laws. Lastly, as described in Article 3, the Judicial branch is the only branch that is not elected by the people. Rather, it is nominated by the executive branch and tasked with interpreting the laws.

When operating as the framers intended, the three branch system is effective in preventing tyranny and balancing power between the branches of government. The legislative and executive branches were designed to insert their will into their work because they were elected and, thus, representatives of the people. However, since the Judiciary is not elected, they are not intended to insert their will into their work. Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist papers number 78 that the Judiciary “has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”

This was how the framers intended the Judiciary to be. However, throughout the years, the courts have been given more power and the system of nominating justices has become largely political. Unfortunately, this means that some will try to take advantage of this power and potential political gain.

Packing the court was last attempted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression. Roosevelt was having difficulties passing extensions to the New Deal as there was significant opposition on the Supreme Court. To combat this, Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. This bill stated that for every justice over the age of 70 years and 6 months who had served on the Supreme Court for over 10 years, the president could nominate a new justice. This would allow Roosevelt to nominate up to six additional justices, and as a result, pack the courts with left-leaning and New Deal-supporting justices. This came just one year after Roosevelt had referred to court packing as “a distasteful idea” at a Cabinet meeting. Roosevelt’s attempt to bypass Constitutional protections was quickly and fervently opposed by multiple justices and elected officials on both sides of the political aisle. However, this debate still continues today. Since such a process has never occurred in American history, many Americans are unaware of the dangers of packing the courts. However, court packing creates a direct threat to the protections against tyranny and mob rule manifested in the Constitution.

The ability of a president to nominate additional justices gives the Executive branch political leverage over the Judicial branch. If a president were to pack the court with partisan and corrupt justices, the justices could essentially create legislation from the bench to benefit their party. In this situation, the political party in charge of the executive branch can receive favorable rulings in virtually every Supreme Court case. Congress, who directly represents the people, would have diminished power because the courts could potentially be used to overturn unfavorable laws. This would leave the Judiciary and president to implement whatever they please, despite the will of the people.

While the Biden campaign has yet to declare whether they would pack the courts, the answer as to if they should is clear. The destruction it would cause to the founding principles, protections, and representative nature of the United States would be incredible, and thus, must not be pursued.
