There are 2 paths. 2 sides, each with a different story. As you walk down the paths, it becomes clear that many have walked where you do now. Many have fought the same battle. The battle to save the lost art of discussion, the art of communication before it became sour, before it was overruled by inconsequential aggressiveness.

 The first path is led by beautiful things. Unity, peace, and acceptance. It is warm and bright, filled with the grace of God and his never ending love. Leaves fly by, signaling hope and prosperity. There are footprints on the ground, going both ways, as it is safe to walk either direction, as each end leads back to God.

The second path is dim. God’s presence still radiates from this path, but it’s colder. The sun doesn’t shine here. The ground is rough, with roots of resentment overgrown throughout the trail. The trees are bare, stripped of their leaves that once told countless stories. The chilled winds whirl past with an essence of

 urgency. Footsteps are still embedded into the ground, but they only go one way. It seems that the ones who walked this path don’t return. Silenced. This is the path of hate, where ideas are halted, where civil conversation has been shut out, replaced with antagonizing tones and words sharp enough to cut.

A thick fog is up ahead. It surrounds the entirety of the paths, making the traveler unsure of which trail he walks. The paths are getting narrow now. The fog is getting heavier. We are lost, but safe, as our hearts are still being guided by God.

The fog will end soon, leaving the traveler to continue their journey.

When the fog ceases, which path will you be on?
