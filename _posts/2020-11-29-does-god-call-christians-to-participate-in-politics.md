Politics is often seen as a separate entity from our entire lives. Politics is not merely a restraint on our corruption after the fall, but it is a central element to our humanity seen from God’s original creation and design. 

In society, it has become common to draw a strict separation between “politics” and the “culture.” Yet, we have seen that separating politics from culture only encourages immorality and injustice. It gives more aid, power, and comfort to those who treat the role of politics as a cynical power game. 

As Christians, we should be as involved in politics and government as much as all other realms of life. Founding Father, John Jay, our first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, says, “Providence has given to our people the choice of their ruler, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.” 

Instead of distancing ourselves from any connection with a civil government, it should be our greatest calling, task, and duty. When Jesus was on earth, He resided and lived under the oppression of an imperial dictatorship. Mark 12:17 declares, “Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they marveled at him” (Mark 12:17, ESV). Jesus was sharing that we have a responsibility to engage in civil matters. We have the God-given opportunity to select leaders and place them into office. Either way, some set of values or moral standards are going to govern and control a nation. 

Yet, as Christians we should desire to get involved in selecting our leaders who will govern according to God’s principles and formulate policy that will be honoring to Him. Every single time a legislature enacts legislation, it has imposing morality. Laws against stealing and thievery impose morality over the honest and the dishonest. Laws that go against prostitution impose sexual morality. A law declaring something legal or illegal is a declaration of something moral or immoral. 

Legislation is established upon morality and ultimately morality is built upon religion. John Adams, our second president, declared: “We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion…Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” God cares about politics, because He cares about everything. Often times we hear Christians say, “God doesn’t care about politics.” Yet this phrase undermines God, and constrains His power. Psalm 24:1 declares, “The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof, the world, and those who dwell therein.” 

The Lord doesn’t limit himself ! He is involved, planning, and making decisions before they even come to pass! The blessing is that God has called us to stand for Him and His righteousness through politics and whatever comes to pass in politics now or in years to come.. God is still in control and we can be confident that His will has been done! God bless America, because God is still in control!!
