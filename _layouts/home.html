    <p>My base hourly rate is <b>$30 USD an hour</b>. However, no two projects I make are quite the same. Thus, this rate can be negotiated, and depends a lot on how much work is needed, the difficulty, and the timeframe you want it completed by.</p>

      I'm a big supporter of open source. A lot of work I do is free for everyone to use, enjoy, and modify as they see fit. However, I still need to earn a living.
    </p>
    <p>If you feel you've benefitted from anything I've made and want to help out (or even if you haven't and just want to help support open source development), please consider buying me a coffee! Even just $5 helps a lot.</p>
